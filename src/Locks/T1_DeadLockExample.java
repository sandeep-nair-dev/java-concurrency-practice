/**
 * <p>
 * In this example, {@code Paper.writeWithPaperAndPen()} tries to access {@code Pen.finishWriting()},
 * and {@code Pen.writeWithPenAndPaper()} tries to access {@code Paper.finishWriting()}.
 * <br>
 * Since both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock so they can proceed,
 * a circular wait occurs â€” resulting in a <b>deadlock</b>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This issue is resolved by ensuring that multiple threads follow a consistent order of acquiring locks.
 * In this example, the solution involves using a synchronized block with a condition in {@code task2}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This ensures that before {@code paper.writeWithPaperAndPen(pen);} is executed,
 * the {@code Pen} instance is not locked and can be accessed.
 * <br>
 * Since {@code task2} waits until {@code Pen} is unlocked, {@code task1} is able to proceed and eventually release its lock.
 * Then, {@code task2} can acquire the necessary lock and continue, thus preventing deadlock.
